# About Card War
Card war is a simple two-player card game that is often played by children. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards in the deck.

To play the game, the deck is shuffled and then divided evenly between the two players. Each player holds their cards face down in a stack, and then each player simultaneously reveals the top card from their stack. The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards, placing them face down at the bottom of their stack.

If both players reveal cards of the same rank, then a "war" occurs. In a war, both players place the next three cards from their stack face down on the table, and then reveal the fourth card. The player with the higher fourth card wins all of the cards on the table, including the cards that were used to start the war. If the fourth card is also tied, then another war occurs until one player has a higher card.
